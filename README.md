Chivalruckus
============

Chivalruckus is a WSH/JS script that continuously presses a voice command
keystroke in [Chivalry: Medieval Warfare][1] so you don't have to!

Just download the zip, run [Chivalry: Medieval Warfare][1], alt-tab, and
double-click one of the BAT files to spam away.  Make sure to close
the command prompt when you are doing anything else besides playing
Chivalry (including text chat in the game!)

If you would prefer to
run the script from a command prompt, open one up, navigate to the
project folder, and type:

```bat
CSCRIPT Chivalruckus.js /message:<message_goes_here>
```

The available messages are below:
```bat
